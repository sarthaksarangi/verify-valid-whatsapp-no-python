# verify-valid-whatsapp-no-python
 This is a python project that takes a txt file as an input and verifies if the phone numbers are valid whatsapp numbers using the whatsapp api. 
 If a phone number is a valid whatsapp number then it writes the phone number onto a different file with the value true/false.
